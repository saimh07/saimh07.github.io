			<h1> About Rainbow Visitor centre </h1>
			<p> A new farm visitor centre has opened near Hawick offering guests an ‘authentic’ experience. A small farm located between Edinburgh and Carlisle has been converted to a visitor attraction that includes a shop selling local produce and plants, small petting zoo, cafe, Play Park and walks. It has been 2 years since it's open and the number of visitors is growing day by day. It first opened with a small shop selling local produc and plants and now it has been converted to a decent size of visitor centre.
